A. PostgreSQL Database Setup for SonarQube
1. Install PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is installed because SonarQube needs a reliable database to store analysis results, metrics, and configurations.

2. Enable PostgreSQL at Startup

The database service is configured to start automatically whenever the system boots, ensuring SonarQube always has database access.

3. Start the PostgreSQL Service

The PostgreSQL server is started so that database operations can be performed immediately.

4. Access PostgreSQL as Administrator

The system switches to the default PostgreSQL administrator account to manage databases and users securely.

5. Create a Dedicated Database User

A new database user is created specifically for SonarQube to improve security and avoid using the default admin account.

6. Create a SonarQube Database

A separate database is created to store SonarQube data, keeping it isolated from other applications.

7. Grant Database Permissions

Full access is given to the SonarQube database user so SonarQube can read, write, and manage its data.

8. Grant Schema Permissions

The user is allowed to work with the database schema so SonarQube can create and manage tables internally.

9. Exit the Database Console

The database configuration is completed and the session is safely closed.

B. Installing SonarQube Application
10. Update System Packages

The system package list is updated to ensure the latest and most secure software versions are installed.

11. Install Java Development Kit

Java is installed because SonarQube runs on the Java platform and cannot function without it.

12. Install File Extraction Utility

An extraction tool is installed to unpack the downloaded SonarQube archive.

13. Verify Java Installation

The Java version is checked to confirm compatibility with SonarQube.

14. Download SonarQube

The SonarQube installation archive is downloaded from the official source.

15. Extract SonarQube Files

The compressed SonarQube package is extracted so the application files can be accessed.

16. Move SonarQube to System Directory

SonarQube files are placed in a standard system directory for better organization and management.

17. Create a Dedicated SonarQube User

A system user is created to run SonarQube securely without login access.

18. Assign File Ownership

The SonarQube user is given ownership of the installation directory to prevent permission issues.

C. Installing SonarScanner CLI
19. Download SonarScanner

SonarScanner is downloaded because it is responsible for scanning source code and sending analysis results to SonarQube.

20. Extract SonarScanner Files

The scanner archive is extracted so its executable files can be used.

21. Move SonarScanner to System Directory

The scanner is moved to a standard directory for system-wide access.

22. Configure SonarScanner

The scanner configuration is updated to point to the local SonarQube server.

23. Grant Execution Permission

Permissions are updated so the scanner can be executed as a command.

24. Make SonarScanner Globally Available

A system link is created so the scanner can be run from anywhere in the terminal.

25. Verify SonarScanner Installation

The scanner version is checked to confirm successful installation.

D. Configuring SonarQube
26. Open SonarQube Configuration File

The main configuration file is accessed to define database and server settings.

27. Configure Database Connection

Database username, password, and connection details are added so SonarQube can connect to PostgreSQL.

28. Configure Web Server Settings

Network and port settings are defined to allow users to access SonarQube through a browser.

29. Increase System Memory Limits

System kernel settings are adjusted to allow SonarQube to handle large workloads.

30. Increase User Resource Limits

File and process limits are increased to prevent SonarQube from crashing under load.

31. Allow Firewall Access

The firewall is configured to allow access to SonarQube’s web interface port.

32. Reload Firewall Rules

Firewall settings are reloaded so changes take effect.

33. Verify Firewall Configuration

Firewall status is checked to ensure only required ports are open.

E. Setting Up SonarQube as a System Service
34. Create a System Service File

A system service definition is created so SonarQube can be managed like other services.

35. Define Service Behavior

Startup, shutdown, user permissions, and resource limits are specified for stable operation.

36. Reload System Services

The system is informed about the new service configuration.

37. Enable SonarQube at Boot

SonarQube is set to start automatically when the system boots.

38. Start the SonarQube Service

The SonarQube service is launched.

39. Verify Service Status

The service status is checked to confirm SonarQube is running correctly.

40. Reboot the System

The system is restarted to ensure all configurations persist and work properly.
